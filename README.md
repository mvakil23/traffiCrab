Base code is from ethan_lipson's workflow.

We need two versions of the files, one for testing on the mac and one for the le potato (libre)

Libre is running Ubuntu 18.04 due to convenience with internet and monitor connection.

These are basic files. The motor angle limits need to be added per motor.
I need to be able to push these files to the libre too.
